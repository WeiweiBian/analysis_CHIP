## Step 1: download data from Zenedo
There are two directories [Analysis.tgz](https://zenodo.org/records/4277001/files/Analysis.tgz?download=1) and [SetupFiles.tgz](https://zenodo.org/records/4277001/files/SetupFiles.tgz?download=1).
It takes ~ 8 hours to download the first directory (18.6GB) it and unfortunately I don't have right to download a portion of it.
